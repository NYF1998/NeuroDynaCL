NeuroDynaCL, a neuroscience-informed GCL framework incorporating two key innovations:
(1) a Triple-branch Dynamics Joint Learning (TDJL) module, guided by prior knowledge of imagined speech brain mechanisms, that models neural dynamics at the brain region, connectivity, and network levels; 
(2) an Adaptive Sample Weighting (ASW) strategy that modulates negative sample hardness to mitigate optimization bias caused by task-related ambiguous boundaries. 
Our work contributes to the advancement of natural BCIs and provides a theoretical and practical foundation for their deployment in intelligent assistive technologies and neurorehabilitation.
